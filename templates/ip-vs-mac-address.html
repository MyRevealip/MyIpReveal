            <h3 class="h5 mt-5">How They Work Together</h3>
            <p>IP and MAC addresses work together to ensure data reaches its correct destination:</p>
            
            <div class="card bg-dark mt-3">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h4 class="h6">Communication Process Example</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Internet Request:</strong> When you want to visit a website, your computer uses DNS to find the IP address of the server hosting the website.</li>
                        <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Your data packet contains the destination IP address, which routers use to forward the packet across the internet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Network:</strong> When the packet reaches the local network segment, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to find the MAC address associated with the destination IP.</li>
                        <li><strong>Final Delivery:</strong> The packet is delivered to the correct device based on its MAC address.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Why Both Are Necessary</h3>
            <p>Both address types serve crucial but complementary roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP addresses</strong> enable global routing across different networks and the internet, functioning like a postal address.</li>
                <li><strong>MAC addresses</strong> provide a unique identifier for each network device, functioning like a name or serial number.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info mt-4">
                <p class="mb-0"><strong>Practical Example:</strong> When a data packet moves from one network to another, routers examine the IP address to determine where to send it. Once the packet reaches the correct network, switches use the MAC address to deliver it to the specific device.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Privacy Considerations</h3>
            <p>Understanding the differences between IP and MAC addresses has privacy implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your <strong>public IP address</strong> is visible to websites you visit and can reveal your approximate location.</li>
                <li>Your <strong>MAC address</strong> isn't visible beyond your local network, but can be used for device tracking within the same network.</li>
                <li>VPNs can mask your real IP address but don't affect your MAC address.</li>
                <li>MAC address randomization (featured in modern mobile operating systems) helps prevent tracking across different Wi-Fi networks.</li>
            </ul>
